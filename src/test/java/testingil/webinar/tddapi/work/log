Step 0: Created empty project
Step 1: Created "readable" tests, not calling a controller
Step 2: Created tests calling test controller, failing on 404 (no urls exposed)
Step 3: Moved controller and data to production, still 404
Step 4: Added URL annotations, failing on 500 (Distance cannot be serialized), add value distance and now failing on logic. At this point, I started using a differnt controller and url designation
Step 5: Added a unit test (and moved Navigator, Exception to Production)
Step 6: Change unit test, cannot be created without location. Test fails, need to change Distance (but that will pass the first test)
Step 7: Passing unit test
