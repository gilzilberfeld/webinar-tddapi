Step 0: Created empty project
Step 1: Created "readable" tests, not calling a controller
Step 2: Created tests calling test controller, failing on 404 (no urls exposed)
Step 3: Moved controller and data to production, still 404
Step 4: Added URL annotations, failing on 500 (Distance cannot be serialized), add value distance and now failing on logic. At this point, I started using a different controller and url designation
Step 5: Added a unit test (and moved Navigator, Exception to Production)
Step 6: Change unit test, cannot be created without location. Test fails, need to change Distance (but that will pass the first test)
Step 7: Passing unit test
Step 8: Added failing unit test, requires refactoring for mocking
Step 9: Comment second test, change first test to include and save the distance provider.
Step 10: Created the Provider's interface (which is really a mock provider), first test is passing 
Step 11: Refactor the test to mock the new Provider.
Step 12: Uncomment second unit test, modify to use mock.
Step 13: Pass the test, fixing Distance
Step 14: Refactor UT: Add BeforeEach, create fields, extract method, 	
Step 15: Add UT for the empty SetDestination.
Step 16: Pass the test by adding code to navigator.
Step 17: Fill controller with calls to Navigator
Step 18: Add configuration and inject provider (test fail).
Step 19: Refactor with unit tests passing - 
			separate Navigator constructor from startpoint, 
			but controller initialization happens before provider is injected
			so API tests fail on null. 

Then: Refactor controller to inject the Provider bean.
Then: Pass the API test
Then: Add MockBean to the Provider
