Step 0: Created empty project
Step 1: Created "readable" tests, not calling a controller
Step 2: Created tests calling test controller
		failing on 404 (no urls exposed)
Step 3: Moved controller and data to production
		still 404 (no urls exposed)
Step 4: Added URL annotations
		failing on 500 (Distance cannot be serialized)
		Added MediaType
		Add value distance and now failing on logic. 
		[At this point, I started using a different controller and url designation]
Step 5: Added a unit test 
		Moved Navigator, Exception to Production
Step 6: Rethink exception, why fail if constructor gets initial location
		Change unit test
		Test fails, 
Step 7: Change Distance 
		Passing unit test
Step 8: Added failing unit test
		Requires refactoring for mocking the distance provider
Step 9: Comment second test
		Change first test to include and save the distance provider.
Step 10:Created the Provider's interface
		Move distance calculation to the provider 
		First test is passing 
Step 11: Refactor the first test to mock the new Provider.
Step 12: Uncomment second unit test, modify to use mock.
Step 13: Add the logic calculation to Distance (*1.6)
		 Pass the test
Step 14: Refactor UT: Add BeforeEach, create fields, extract method, 	
Step 15: Add UT for passing the correct info to the provider 
		 Fails because of empty SetDestination.
Step 16: Store the destination in Navigator
		 Pass the test
		 Unit tests are ok, we can move back to controller
Step 17: Fill controller with calls to Navigator
Step 18: API Tests : Add configuration and inject provider 
		 Test fail becuase we create Nav twice.
		 We need to create once, but that means seperating from the initial location
Step 19: Separate Navigator constructor from startpoint, 
		 But controller initialization happens *before* provider is injected
		 API tests fail on null. 
Step final: Inject Navigator instead of creating it. 
			Also some test refactoring.
